    @importMX

Imports all the MusicXML types in case you are sure no conflicts happens.

# Just put it in the code:
```julia
@importMX # gets translated to: import MusicXML: ScorePartwise, Part, Measure, Note, Chord, Unpitched, Rest, Pitch, Attributes, Time, Transpose, Clef, Key, PartList, ScorePart, MidiInstrument, MidiDevice, ScoreInstrument
```

# Type Helper Macro
export @MX
"""
    @MX

A macro that adds `MX.` to the name of the MusicXML types.

Since MusicXML's types are not exported from the package to avoid conflicts with the similarly named types from other libraries (such as `Dates.Time`, `MIDI.Note`), `@MX` is given that facilitates using MusicXML types.

`@MX` assumes that all the types with these kinds of names inside in front of a macro, between `()`, or between `begin end` are MusicXML types unless explicitly written (e.g. `MIDI.Note`).

!!! warn
    It will replace the name of the types if they are used inside strings.

# Examples
```julia
@MX begin
    Note(pitch = Pitch(step = "C", alter = 0, octave = 4), duration =  4))
    # all the code ...
end
```
is translated to:
```julia
    MX.Note(pitch = Pitch(step = "C", alter = 0, octave = 4), duration =  4))
```

Type is untouched if it is called explicitly from another library:
```julia
@MX Dates.Time(12,53,40)
```
remains as:
```julia
Dates.Time(12,53,40)
```
