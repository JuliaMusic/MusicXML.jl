This includes key and time signatures, clefs, transpositions, and staving. When attributes are changed mid-measure, it affects the music in score order, not in MusicXML document order.\n\nkey: See Key doc\n\ndivisions: Musical notation duration is commonly represented as fractions. The divisions element indicates how many divisions per quarter note are used to indicate a note's duration. For example, if duration = 1 and divisions = 2, this is an eighth note duration. Duration and divisions are used directly for generating sound output, so they must be chosen to take tuplets into account. Using a divisions element lets us use just one number to represent a duration for each note in the score, while retaining the full power of a fractional representation. If maximum compatibility with Standard MIDI 1.0 files is important, do not have the divisions value exceed 16383.\n\ntime: See Time doc\n\nstaves: The staves element is used if there is more than one staff represented in the given part (e.g., 2 staves for typical piano parts). If absent, a value of 1 is assumed. Staves are ordered from top to bottom in a part in numerical order, with staff 1 above staff 2.\n\ninstruments: The instruments element is only used if more than one instrument is represented in the part (e.g., oboe I and II where they play together most of the time). If absent, a value of 1 is assumed.\n\nclef: See Clef doc\n\nMore info\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#MusicXML.Clef","page":"Home","title":"MusicXML.Clef","text":"Clef\n\n...\n\nArguments\n\nsign::String\nline::Int16\nxml::Node\n\n...\n\nA type to hold clef information for a measure in musicxml file.\n\nClefs are represented by a combination of sign, line, and clef-octave-change elements. Clefs appear at the start of each system unless the print-object attribute has been set to \"no\" or the additional attribute has been set to \"yes\".\n\nsign: The sign element represents the clef symbol: G, F, C, percussion, TAB, jianpu, none. More info\n\nline: Line numbers are counted from the bottom of the staff. Standard values are 2 for the G sign (treble clef), 4 for the F sign (bass clef), 3 for the C sign (alto clef) and 5 for TAB (on a 6-line staff).\n\nMore info\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#MusicXML.Key","page":"Home","title":"MusicXML.Key","text":"Key\n\n...\n\nArguments\n\nfifth::Int8\nmode::Union{Nothing,String}\nxml::Node\n\n...\n\nA type to hold key information for a measure in musicxml file.\n\nThe key element represents a key signature. Both traditional and non-traditional key signatures are supported. The optional number attribute refers to staff numbers. If absent, the key signature applies to all staves in the part.\n\nfifth: number of flats or sharps in a traditional key signature. Negative numbers are used for flats and positive numbers for sharps, reflecting the key's placement within the circle of fifths\n\nmode:  major, minor, dorian, phrygian, lydian, mixolydian, aeolian, ionian, locrian, none\n\nMore info\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#MusicXML.Measure","page":"Home","title":"MusicXML.Measure","text":"Measure\n\n...\n\nArguments\n\nattributes::Union{Nothing,Attributes}\nnotes::Vector{Note}\nxml::Node\n\n...\n\nA type to hold the data for a musicxml measure\n\nattributes: See Attributes doc notes: See Note doc\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#MusicXML.Mididevice","page":"Home","title":"MusicXML.Mididevice","text":"Mididevice\n\n...\n\nArguments\n\nport::Int16\nID::String\nxml::Node\n\n...\n\nThe midi-device type corresponds to the DeviceName meta event in Standard MIDI Files.

The MusicXML format keeps the MuseData distinction between elements used for sound information and elements used for notation information (e.g., tie is used for sound, tied for notation). Thus grace notes do not have a duration element. Cue notes have a duration element, as do forward elements, but no tie elements. Having these two types of information available can make interchange considerably easier, as some programs handle one type of information much more readily than the other.\n\npitch: See Pitch doc\n\nduration : See MIDI.Note doc\n\ntype: Type indicates the graphic note type, Valid values (from shortest to longest) are 1024th, 512th, 256th, 128th, 64th, 32nd, 16th, eighth, quarter, half, whole, breve, long, and maxima. The size attribute indicates full, cue, or large size, with full the default for regular notes and cue the default for cue and grace notes.\n\naccidental: The accidental type represents actual notated accidentals. Editorial and cautionary indications are indicated by attributes. Values for these attributes are \"no\" if not present. Specific graphic display such as parentheses, brackets, and size are controlled by the level-display attribute group. Empty accidental objects are not allowed.

A score-instrument type is also required if the score specifies MIDI 1.0 channels, banks, or programs. An initial midi-instrument assignment can also be made here.
