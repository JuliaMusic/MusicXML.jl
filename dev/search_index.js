This includes key and time signatures, clefs, transpositions, and staving. When attributes are changed mid-measure, it affects the music in score order, not in MusicXML document order.\n\nkey: See Key doc\n\ndivisions: The divisions element indicates how many divisions per quarter note are used to indicate a note's duration. Note.duration/Attributes.divisions gives the actual duration of a note. Should be given based on the shortest note in the measure. If you use 16th notes give 4, and give duration for the notes as 1. For example, if divisions = 2, and we have a Note with duration = 1 this is an eighth note duration. The default value is 4, which means each duration = 1 means a 16th note.\n\nDuration and divisions are used directly for generating sound output, so they must be chosen to take tuplets into account. Using a divisions element lets us use just one number to represent a duration for each note in the score, while retaining the full power of a fractional representation. If maximum compatibility with Standard MIDI 1.0 files is important, do not have the divisions value exceed 16383.\n\ntime: See Time doc\n\nstaves: The staves element is used if there is more than one staff represented in the given part (e.g., 2 staves for typical piano parts).
