using Pkg
Pkg.add("MusicXML")
```
```julia
using MusicXML
```

# Creating Example
```julia
using MusicXML

@MX begin # adds `MX.` to the name of all MusicXML types

## Part List

# Parsing Example
```julia
using MusicXML

# Reads musicxml file and then extracts the data, builds all the types and stores them in proper format.
scorepartwise = readmusicxml( "musescore.musicxml")

# Example 1:
# Prints Each instrument name and then the pitches

# Extracting each instrument information
scprts = scorepartwise.partlist.scoreparts

# Extracting parts
prts = scorepartwise.parts

# Extracting each part
for prt in prts

    ind = findfirst(x -> prt.id == x.id, scprts) # returns the index of scorepart that matches the id of part

    # printing the instrument name
    println(scprts[ind].name)

    # Extracting each measure of the part
    iMsr=1
    for msr in prt.measures
        # Extracting notes of each measure
        for nt in msr.notes
            if !isnothing(nt.pitch)

                println("Measure no. $iMsr")    # print measure number
                println(nt.pitch)     # print pitch of the note
                println(nt.duration)  # print duration of the note
            elseif !isnothing(nt.unpitched)
                println("Measure no. $iMsr")    # print measure number
                println(nt.unpitched) # print unpitched of the note

# Types and Functions

You can use among these exported types and functions:

## I/O functions
```julia
readmusicxml, parsemusicxml
```

## Typess:

Since MusicXML's types are not exported from the package to avoid conflicts with the similarly named types from other libraries (such as `Dates.Time`, `MIDI.Note`),
1) you should either `import` the types yourself if you are sure that there is no conflict. Use `@importMX` to `import` all the types.
2) or us `MX.` before the type names (which `MX` is an alias for `MusicXML`)
3) or use `@MX` macro, which adds `MX.` automatically to the type names. See `@MX` docstring for examples.

```
ScorePartwise
	partlist (PartList)
		scoreparts (Vector{ScorePart})
			name
			id
			scoreinstrument (ScoreInstrument)
				name
				id
			mididevice (MidiDevice)
				port
				id
			midiinstrument (MidiInstrument)
				channel
				program
				volume
				pan
				id
	part (Part)
		id
		measures (Vector{Measure})
			attributes (Attributes)
				divisions
				key (Key)
					fifth
					mode
				time (Time)
					beats
					beattype
				staves
				instruments
				clefs (Vector{Clef})
					sign
					line
				transpose (Transpose)
					diatonic
					chromatic
					octaveChange
					double
			notes (Vector{Note})
				pitch (Pitch)
					step
					alter
					octave
				rest (Rest)
				unpitched (Unpitched)
				duration
				type
				accidental
				chord (Chord)
```

For fieldnames, if it is a Vector it has `s` at the end of the word.

For types, names are capitalized for each word (Camel convention):
```
ScorePartwise, Part, Measure, Note, Chord, Unpitched, Rest, Pitch, Attributes, Time, Transpose, Clef, Key, PartList, ScorePart, MidiInstrument, MidiDevice, ScoreInstrument
```

## Utilities
```julia
pitch2xml, xml2pitch
```
