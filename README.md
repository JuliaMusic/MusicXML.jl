Powerful MusicXML reading and writing package for Julia.

# Installation
```julia
] add https://github.com/JuliaMusic/MusicXML.jl
```


# Usage Example
```julia
using MusicXML

# Reads musicxml file and then extracts the data, builds all the types and stores them in proper format.
scorepartwise = readmusicxml( "musescore.musicxml")

# Example 1:
# Prints Each instrument name and then the pitches

# Extracting each instrument information
scprts = scorepartwise.partlist.scoreparts

# Extracting parts
prts = scorepartwise.parts

# Extracting each part
for prt in prts

    ind = findfirst(x -> prt.id == x.id, scprts) # returns the index of scorepart that matches the id of part

    # printing the instrument name
    println(scprts[ind].name)

    # Extracting each measure of the part
    iMsr=1
    for msr in prt.measures
        # Extracting notes of each measure
        for nt in msr.notes
            if !isnothing(nt.pitch)

                println("Measure no. $iMsr")    # print measure number
                println(nt.pitch)     # print pitch of the note
                println(nt.duration)  # print duration of the note
            elseif !isnothing(nt.unpitched)
                println("Measure no. $iMsr")    # print measure number
                println(nt.unpitched) # print unpitched of the note
                println(nt.duration)  # print duration of the note
            end

        end

        iMsr+=1
    end
end
```


# Types and Functions

You can use among these exported types and functions:

## I/O functions
```julia
readmusicxml, parsemusicxml
```

## Typess:

```
ScorePartwise
	partlist (PartList)
		scoreparts (Vector{ScorePart})
			name
			id
			scoreinstrument (ScoreInstrument)
				name
				id
			mididevice (MidiDevice)
				port
				id
			midiinstrument (MidiInstrument)
				channel
				program
				volume
				pan
				id
	part (Part)
		id
		measures (Vector{Measure})
			attributes (Attributes)
				divisions
				key (Key)
					fifth
					mode
				time (Time)
					beats
					beattype
				staves
				instruments
				clef (Clef)
					sign
					line
				transpose (Transpose)
					diatonic
					chromatic
					octaveChange
					double
			notes (Vector{NoteX})
				pitch (Pitch)
					step
					alter
					octave
				rest (Rest)
				unpitched (Unpitched)
				duration
				type
				accidental
```

For fieldnames, if it is a Vector it has `s` at the end of the word.

For types, names are capitalized for each word (Camel convention):
```
ScorePartwise, Part, Measure, NoteX, Unpitched, Rest, Pitch, Attributes, Time, Transpose, Clef, Key, PartList, ScorePart, MidiInstrument, MidiDevice, ScoreInstrument
```


## Utilities
```julia
pitch2xml, xml2pitch
```
