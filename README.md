Powerful MusicXML reading and writing package for Julia.

# Installation
```julia
] add https://github.com/JuliaMusic/MusicXML.jl
```


# Usage Example
```julia
using MusicXML

# Reads musicxml file and then extracts the data, builds all the types and stores them in proper format.
scorepartwise = readmusicxml( "musescore.musicxml")

# Example 1:
# Prints Each instrument name and then the pitches

# Extracting each instrument information
scprts = scorepartwise.partlist.scoreparts

# Extracting parts
prts = scorepartwise.parts

# Extracting each part
for prt in prts

    ind = findfirst(x -> prt.id == x.id, scprts) # returns the index of scorepart that matches the id of part

    # printing the instrument name
    println(scprts[ind].name)

    # Extracting each measure of the part
    iMsr=1
    for msr in prt.measures
        # Extracting notes of each measure
        for nt in msr.notes
            if !isnothing(nt.pitch)

                println("Measure no. $iMsr")    # print measure number
                println(nt.pitch)     # print pitch of the note
                println(nt.duration)  # print duration of the note
            elseif !isnothing(nt.unpitched)
                println("Measure no. $iMsr")    # print measure number
                println(nt.unpitched) # print unpitched of the note
                println(nt.duration)  # print duration of the note
            end

        end

        iMsr+=1
    end
end
```


# Types and Functions

You can use among these exported types and functions:

## I/O functions
```julia
readmusicxml, parsemusicxml
```

## Types:

```
scorepartwise
	partlist
		scoreparts
			name
			id
			ScoreInstrument
				name
				id
			MidiDevice
				port

					diatonic
					chromatic
					octaveChange
					double
			notes
				pitch
					step
					alter

```

For naming, If the fieldname is a Vector it has `s` at the end of the word.

For naming, types are first letter captalized of the field names:
```
ScorePartwise, Part, Measure, NoteX, Unpitched, Rest, Pitch, Attributes, Time, Transpose, Clef, Key, PartList, ScorePart, MidiInstrument, MidiDevice, ScoreInstrument
```


## Utilities
```julia
pitch2xml, xml2pitch
```
